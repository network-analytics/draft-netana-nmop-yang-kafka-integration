Internet-Draft    YANG-Push to Apache Kafka Integration    February 2024


1.  Introduction

   Nowadays network operators are using YANG [RFC7950] to model their
   configurations and obtain YANG modelled data from their networks.  It
   is well understood that plain text are initially intended for humans
   and need effort to make it machine readable due to the lack of
   semantics.  YANG modeled data is addressing this need.

   Increasingly more network operators organizing their data in a Data
   Mesh [Deh22] where a message broker such as Apache Kafka [Kaf11] or
   RabbitMQ [Rab07] facilitates the exchange of messages among data
   processing components like a stream processor to filter, enrich,
   correlate or aggregate, or a time series database to store data.

   Even though YANG is intend to ease the handling of data, this promise
   has not yet been fulfilled for Network Telemetry.  From subscribing
   on a YANG datastore, publishing a YANG modeled notification message
   from the network and viewing the data in a time series database,
   manual labor is needed to perform a data transformation to make a
   message broker and its data processing components with YANG
   notifications interoparable.

1.1.  Document Scope

   This document focuses on YANG-Push [RFC8639] as the messaging
   protocol between the network node and the Network Telemetry [RFC9232]
   data collection since YANG push contains a subscription id describing
   the event stream filter of the subscribed YANG data.  For a message
   broker and schema registry it focuses on Apache Kafka and Confluent
   Schema Registry [Con18] due its native capability to support
   different serializers and schema languages, scales out well and being
   a de-facto standard for network operators today.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document makes use of the terms defined in [RFC8639], Apache
   Kafka [Kaf11] and Confluent Schema Registry Documentation [ConDoc18].

   The following terms are used as defined in [RFC8639].

1.3.  Origins of YANG-Push

   With [RFC3535] the IAB set the requirements for Network Management in
   2003.  From these requirements NETCONF [RFC6241], NETCONF
   Notifications [RFC5277] and Restconf [RFC8040] has been defined to
   configure through <edit-config> and retrieve operational data through
   <get> and NETCONF notifications through <notification> from a YANG
   datastore on a network node.

   With YANG-Push, as defined in [RFC8639], [RFC8640] and [RFC8641],
   periodical and on-change subscriptions to the YANG datastore can be
   dynamically configured or statically configured.  When dynamically
   configured, messages are being published in the established NETCONF
   session, where when statically configured messages are being
   published through HTTPS-based [I-D.ietf-netconf-https-notif] or
   UDP-based [I-D.ietf-netconf-udp-notif] transport.  Section 3.7 of
   [RFC8641] describes push-update messages where the YANG subscribed

   data is being published, where Section 2.7 of [RFC8639] describes the
   subscription state change notifications where changes in the
   subscription are being described.

1.4.  Origins of Apache Kafka

   Apache Kafka [Kaf11] messages can be produced into so called topics
   and consumed from.  Each topic has one or more partitions where
   messages are replicated or loadbalanced to scale out.  With the
   introduction of Confluent Schema Registry [Con18] a topic can contain
   one or more subjects.  A subject refers to a schema definition.  The
   schema definition or the schema ID can be either prefixed to the
   message with the Apache Kafka serializer.  If the schema ID is
   prefixed, the schema needs to be previously be registered through a
   REST API to the Confluent Schema Registry where a schema ID is being
   issued.  Messages can be validated against schema when produced or
   consumed from topic to ensure schema integrity of the message.  The
   type of schema evolution scheme can be defined per subject.  Wherever
   non backward schema changes are allowed or not.

2.  Motivation

   Text.

2.1.  Preserve Semantics

   The preservation of the YANG semantics, that includes the YANG data
   types as defined in [RFC6991] and the nested structure of the YANG
   module, throughout the data processing chain ensures that metrics can
   be processed and visualized as they were originally intended.  Not
   only for the user but also for an automated closed loop operation
   action.

2.2.  Preserve Semantic Information

   [RFC7950] defines in Section 7.21.3 and 7.21.4 the description and
   reference statement.  This information is intended for the user,
   describing in a human-readable fashion the meaning of a definition.
   In Data Mesh, this information can be imported from the Confluent
   Schema Registry into a Stream Catalog where subjects within Apache
   Kafka are identifyable and searchable.  An example of a Stream
   Catalog is Apache Atlas [Atl15].  It can also be applied for time
   series data visualization in a similar fashion.

2.3.  Standardize Data Processing Integration

   Since the YANG schema is preserved for operational metrics in Apache
   Kafka, a standartization for integration betwen network data
   collection and stream processor or time series database is implied.

3.  Elements of the Architecture

   The architecture consists of 6 elements.

3.1.  YANG-Push Subscription

   With step number (1) in the workflow diagram, a YANG-Push
   subscription is according to Section 2.4 and 2.5 of [RFC8639]
   dynamically or statically configured, and with step (2) subscription
   state change notifications are sent according to section 2.7 from the
   YANG-Push publisher to the receiver to inform which event stream
   filter has been applied to which subscription ID.

   [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-notifications-versioning] adds the capability
   to subscribe to a specific YANG module revision or a YANG module
   which needs to be backward compatible to in step (1) and adds the
   module name, revision and revision-label information into the
   subscription state change notifications in step (2).

3.2.  YANG-Push Publisher

   With step number (4) in the workflow diagram, a YANG-Push push-update
   or push-change-update message, depending on wherever periodical or
   on-change subscription has been established, is sent from the YANG-
   Push publisher to the receiver according to Section 3.7 of [RFC8639].

   [I-D.ahuang-netconf-notif-yang] defines the NETCONF notification
   header specified in [RFC5277] in YANG to enable JSON and CBOR
   encoding.

   [I-D.tgraf-netconf-notif-sequencing] adds sysName, messagePublisherId
   and sequenceNumber in the NETCONF notification header to each message
   to identify from which network node and publishing process according
   to [I-D.ietf-netconf-distributed-notif] a network node with
   distributed architecture could have multiple messagePublisherId's,
   the message has been published from.  The sequenceNumber enables to
   measure from the YANG-Push publisher down to the Time Series Database
   Ingestion in step (11) to recognize loss.

   [I-D.tgraf-netconf-yang-push-observation-time] adds observation-time
   or state-changed-observation-time in the YANG-Push push-update or
   push-change-update message, depending on wherever periodical or on-
   change subscription has been established.  observation-time describes
   when the operational metrics was obtained from the YANG datastore.
   Where state-changed-observation-time describes when the network state
   change was observed.

3.3.  YANG-Push Receiver

   For all the YANG modules and revisions of each subscription ID in the
   subscription state change notification received in step number (3) in
   the workflow diagram, through the YANG Library [RFC8525], all the
   YANG module depencies need to be determined and then through NETCONF
   <get-schema> rpc call according to [RFC6022] all YANG modules
   retrieved as described in step (3) in the workflow diagram.

   [I-D.lincla-netconf-yang-library-augmentation] extends the YANG
   Library so that not only the submodule but also the augmentation list
   can be obtained.

3.4.  YANG Schema Registry

   Confluent Schema Registry is pluggable.  Supports AVRO, JSON Schema
   and protobuf natively.  In order to support YANG natively.....
