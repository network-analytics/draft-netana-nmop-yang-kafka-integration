Internet-Draft   YANG-Push to Message Broker Integration   February 2026


1.  Introduction

   Nowadays network operators are using YANG [RFC7950] to model their
   configurations and obtain YANG modelled data from their networks.  It
   is well understood that plain text are initially intended for humans
   and need effort to make it machine readable due to the lack of
   semantics.  YANG modeled data is addressing most of these needs.

   Increasingly more network operators organizing their data in a Data
   Mesh [Deh22] where a Message Broker such as Apache Kafka [Kaf11] or
   Apache Pulsar [Pul16] facilitates the exchange of messages among data
   processing components like a stream processor to filter, enrich,
   correlate or aggregate, or a time series database to store data.

   Even though YANG is intended to ease the handling of data, this
   promise has not yet been fulfilled for Network Telemetry [RFC9232].
   From subscribing on a YANG datastore, publishing a YANG modeled
   notifications message from the network and viewing the data in a time
   series database, manual labor, such as obtaining the YANG schema from
   the network and creating a transformation or ingestion specification
   into a time series database, is needed to make a Message Broker and
   its data processing components with YANG notifications interoparable.
   Since YANG modules can change over time, for example when a router is
   being upgraded to a newer software release, this process needs to be
   adjusted contionously, leading often to errors in the data chain if
   dependencies are not properly tracked and schema changes adjusted
   simultaneously.

1.1.  Origins of YANG-Push

   With [RFC3535] the IAB set the requirements for Network Management in
   2003.  From these requirements NETCONF [RFC6241], NETCONF
   Notifications [RFC5277] and RESTCONF [RFC8040] have been defined to
   configure through <edit-config> and retrieve operational data through
   <get> and NETCONF notifications through <notification> from a YANG
   datastore on a network node.

Internet-Draft   YANG-Push to Message Broker Integration   February 2026


   With YANG-Push, as defined in [RFC8639], [RFC8640] and [RFC8641],
   periodical and on-change subscriptions to the YANG datastore can be
   dynamically or statically configured.  When notifications are
   dynamically configured, messages are published over the initially
   established NETCONF session, while when it is statically configured
   messages are published through HTTPS-based
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-https-notif] or UDP-based
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-udp-notif] transport.  Section 3.7 of [RFC8641]
   describes push-update messages where the YANG subscribed data is
   being published, where Section 2.7 of [RFC8639] describes the
   subscription state change notifications were changes in the
   Subscription are being described.

1.2.  Origins of Apache Kafka

   Apache Kafka [Kaf11] is a Message Broker that supports producing and
   consuming messages from so called topics.  Each topic has one or more
   partitions where messages are replicated or load balanced to scale
   out.  With the introduction of Confluent Schema Registry [Con18] a
   topic can contain one or more subjects.  A subject refers to a Schema
   defining the structure of the message.  The Schema then is used to
   validate messages sent through topics and are identified by a Schema
   ID.  The Schema ID is issued when the Schema is registered to the
   Confluent Schema Registry.  Once the Schema ID is obtained, it can be
   prefixed to the message with a Confluent Schema Registry compatible
   serializer.  Messages can then be validated against Schema at the
   producer or at the consumer from a topic to ensure Schema integrity
   of the message.  The type of Schema evolution scheme can be defined
   per subject, whether non backward compatibility changes are allowed
   or not.

1.3.  Document Scope

   This document focuses on YANG-Push [RFC8641] as the messaging
   protocol between network nodes and Network Telemetry [RFC9232] data
   collection.  It describes the main components and the aimed
   architecture for deploying such solution in a production network.
   Then, it illustrates the integration of the YANG 1.1 [RFC7950] as a
   schema modeling language into the Apache Kafka Message Broker and
   Confluent Schema Registry [Con18].

2.1.  Terminology

   This document defines the following terms:

   Message Broker: is an intermediary software component that translates
   messages from the formal messaging protocol of the sender to the
   formal messaging protocol of the receiver routed in topics [Kaf11].
   Message brokers are elements in Data Mesh where software applications
   communicate by exchanging formally-defined messages.

   Stream Catalog: provides a single point of access that allows users
   to centrally search semantics for information across a Message
   Broker.

   Additionally it makes use of the terms defined in [RFC8639],
   [RFC7950], Apache Kafka [Kaf11], Confluent Schema Registry
   Documentation [ConDoc18] and Data Mesh [Deh22].

   The following terms are used as defined in [RFC8639]:

   *  Publisher

   *  Receiver

   *  Subscription

   *  Subscription ID

   *  Event stream filter

   *  Notification message

   The following terms are used as defined in Apache Kafka Message
   Broker [Kaf11]:

   *  Producer

   *  Consumer

   *  Topic

   *  Partition

   The following terms are used as defined in Confluent Schema Registry
   Documentation [ConDoc18]:

   *  Schema

Internet-Draft   YANG-Push to Message Broker Integration   February 2026


   *  Schema ID

   *  Schema Registry

   *  Subject

   The following terms are used as defined in Data Mesh [Deh22]:

   *  Data Product: A logical unit that contains all components to
      publish, process and store domain data for analytical or data-
      intensive use cases.

   *  Service Level Objective: Is a target value or range of values for
      a service level that is measured by an service level indicator.

   *  Service Level Indicator: Is a measure of a service level provided
      by a service provider to a customer.

   This document defines the following terms:

   *  YANG Schema Registry: Stores YANG schemas and has an API for
      registering and retrieving YANG schemas for YANG Message Broker
      Producers and Consumers.  See Section 4.4.

   *  YANG Message Broker Producer: Serializes YANG telemetry messages
      from previously retrieved YANG notifications From YANG-Push
      Receiver and registers YANG schemas at YANG Schema Registry for
      the serialized telemetry messages.  See Section 4.6.

   *  YANG Message Broker Consumer: De-Serializes YANG telemetry
      messages from Message Broker and retrieve YANG schemas for the
      serialized telemetry messages from YANG Schema Registry.  See
      Section 4.7.

   *  YANG Data Consumer: Transforms and ingests previously obtained
      YANG notfications from Message Broker into YANG Data Storage by
      leveraging YANG schemas from YANG Schema Registry.  See
      Section 4.8.

   *  YANG Data Storage: Stores and indexes YANG data retrieved through
      YANG notifications.  See Section 4.9.

3.  Motivation

   There are four main objectives for native YANG-Push notifications and
   YANG Schema integration into a Message Broker.

3.1.  Automatic Onboarding

   Automate the Data Mesh onboarding of newly subscribed YANG metrics.

3.2.  Preserve Schema

   The preservation of the YANG schema, that includes the YANG data
   types as defined in [RFC6991] and the nested structure of the YANG
   module, the data taxonomy, throughout the data processing chain
   ensures that metrics can be processed and visualized as they were
   originally intended.  Not only for users but also for automated
   closed loop operation actions.

3.3.  Preserve Semantic Information

   [RFC7950] defines in Section 7.21.3 and 7.21.4 the description and
   reference statement.  This information is intended for the user,
   describing in a human-readable fashion the meaning of a definition.
   In Data Mesh, this information can be imported from the YANG Schema
   Registry into a Stream Catalog where subjects within Message Broker
   are identifiable and searchable.  An example of a Stream Catalog is
   Apache Atlas [Atl15].  It can also be applied for time series data
   visualization in a similar fashion.

3.4.  Standardize Data Processing Integration

   Since the YANG Schema is preserved for operational metrics in the
   Message Broker, a standardization for integration between network
   data collection and stream processors or time series databases is
   implied.

4.  Elements of the Architecture

   The architecture consists of 10 elements.  Figure 1 gives an overview
   on the workflow.

4.1.  YANG-Push Subscription

   With step number (1) in the workflow diagram, the YANG-Push
   notification transport capabilities are being discovered according to
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-yp-transport-capabilities], notification
   capabilities according to [I-D.ietf-netconf-notif-envelope] and
   notification subscription capabilities according to Section 3 of
   [RFC9196].

   With step (2) a YANG-Push subscription according to Section 2.4 and
   2.5 of [RFC8639] is dynamically or statically configured.

   With step (3) subscription start notifications are sent according to
   Section 2.7 of [RFC8639] from the YANG-Push Publisher to the Receiver
   to inform which event stream filter has been applied to which
   Subscription ID.

   When the YANG-Push Subscription is managed dynamically, the YANG data
   is being received on the same NETCONF session where the Subscription
   is being maintained.  With configured Subscription the YANG data is
   sent to the YANG-Push Receiver through a separate transport session.

   [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-notifications-versioning] adds the capability
   to subscribe to a specific YANG module revision or backward
   compatible YANG module in step (2) and adds the module name,
   revision, revision-label and yang-library-content-id information into
   the subscription state change notifications in step (3).

   Figure 2 provides an example how to create a YANG-Push configured
   Subscription with NETCONF in XML [W3C.REC-xml-20081126] with UDP-
   based [I-D.ietf-netconf-udp-notif] transport

4.2.  YANG-Push Publisher

   With step number (4) in the workflow diagram, a YANG-Push push-update
   or push-change-update message, depending on wherever periodical or
   on-change Subscription has been established, is sent from the YANG-
   Push Publisher to the receiver according to Section 3.7 of [RFC8639].

   [I-D.ietf-netconf-notif-envelope] defines the YANG-Push notification
   header in YANG with event-time, hostname and sequence-number to
   enable a YANG data consumer to use the hostname to recognize which
   network node the message was published from and with sequence-number
   message reordering or loss.

   [I-D.ietf-netconf-distributed-notif] adds a message-publisher-id for
   network nodes with distributed architecture where multiple YANG-Push
   publishing processes are publishing messages.  The message-publisher-
   id enables a YANG data consumer to recognize from which YANG-Push
   Publisher process the message was published from.

   Section 3.5.1 of [I-D.ietf-netconf-notif-envelope] adds observation
   timestamp and point-in-time in the YANG-Push push-update or push-
   change-update message.  The observation timestamp contains the
   timestamp and point-in-time when the metrics where observed.

4.3.  YANG-Push Receiver

   For all the YANG modules and revisions of each hostname and
   Subscription ID in the subscription state change notification
   received in step number (3) in the workflow diagram, all the YANG
   module dependencies need to be determined through the YANG Library
   [RFC8525] and the import statements in the YANG modules.  The
   dependencies include: imports, augments, deviations and features
   being used for each YANG module.  Through NETCONF <get-schema> RPC
   calls, [RFC6022], all YANG modules need to be retrieved as described
   in step (4) in the workflow diagram.

   YANG Library [RFC8525] already supports the discovery of submodules,
   deviations and features but misses augments.
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-library-augmentedby] extends the YANG Library
   so that also the list of YANG modules which have direct augmentations
   are listed.

   A change in xpath or sub-tree filter or module name in the
   subscription state change notifications indicates that the subscribed
   path has changed.  A change in revision indicates that the version of
   the YANG module of the subscribed path has changed, where revision-
   label indicates wherever the revision was backward compatible or not.
   YANG Libary content-id changes indicates that there were potential
   semantic changes in the augmented or imported YANG modules of the
   subscribed xpath or sub-tree.  If no change to previous subscription
   state is observed, step 4 can be omitted.

   Figure 9 in Section 4.1 and YANG module in Section 5 of [RFC8641]
   defines the payload of YANG-push notifications where "datastore-
   contents" or the "value" of a "push-change-update") is "anydata".
   [I-D.netana-nmop-yang-anydata-validation] extends Section 7.10 of
   [RFC7950] by describing how validate Schema integrity of the anydata
   content.

4.4.  YANG Schema Registry

   The schema registry SHOULD support YANG as the format for defining
   schema and has the ability to store metadata along with the schema.
   For each schema registered into the schema registry, a schema ID is
   returned.  That schema ID can be used when interacting with the
   Message Broker to indicate the schema to use with the message.

   Confluent Schema Registry is pluggable.  Currently Supports AVRO,
   JSON Schema and Protobuf.  The YANG support is being developed at
   [Yak24] as part of this architecture.  Enable to register, obtain and
   compare [YSR24] YANG Schemas.  One YANG Schema with all its
   augmentations is being registered per YANG-Push subscription ID along

   with metadata describing which YANG features were enabled for the
   registered YANG schema.  For each YANG Schema a locally significant
   Schema ID is being issued as described in step (7) in the workflow
   diagram.

4.5.  Stream Catalog

   The YANG schemas in the YANG schema registry are made accessible to
   the Stream Catalog where users have an overview and search on
   available semantics in the Message Broker.

4.6.  YANG Message Broker Producer

   The previously issued Schema ID is prefixed to the metadata augmented
   YANG push push-update message previously described in Section 4.3
   before serialized to a Message Broker topic in step (8) of the
   workflow diagram.

   Section 2 of [I-D.ietf-nmop-message-broker-telemetry-message] defines
   the envelope schema of the message facilitating the YANG-Push and
   different types of provenance metadata.

4.7.  YANG Message Broker Consumer

   From the Message Broker topic the message is being consumed and the
   prefixed Schema ID is being used in step (10) of the workflow diagram
   to retrieve the YANG Schema to validate the Schema integrity of the
   message.

   In order to validate Schema integrity, the event stream filter of the
   Subscription ID in the subscription started notification
   Section 4.3.1 of [RFC8641] or telemetry message Section 3 of
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-message-broker-telemetry-message] is needed to apply
   [I-D.netana-nmop-yang-anydata-validation] on the YANG schema tree.

4.8.  YANG Data Consumer

   The data storage ingestion specifications are being derived with the
   in Section 4.7 already retrieved Schema ID and YANG-Push push-update
   messages can be now ingested and indexed into the data storage table
   according to their schema in step (12).

   By tracking the YANG-Push notification sequence-number for a given
   hostname as defined in Section 3.4 of
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-notif-envelope] loss can be recognized accross the
   YANG data processing chain.  By taking the event-time in the YANG-
   Push notification header and the time the YANG-Push notification
   messages was consumed into account, the serialization delay between
   YANG-Push publisher and YANG Data Consumer can be measured.

   The loss rate and delay for a given hostname can be used as a Service
   Level Indicator for the YANG data product in the Data Mesh [Deh22].

4.9.  YANG Data Storage

   The YANG data is ingested in step (12)according to the previously
   defined ingestion specification and indexed with the observation
   timestamp as defined in Section 3.5.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-notif-envelope].  A network operator is now able to
   query the previously subscribed YANG data.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

      through the YANG Library [RFC8525] and retrieved throug NETCONF
      <get-schema> rpc calls according to [RFC6022].  Gap in YANG
      library addressed in [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-library-augmentedby].

   IETF 119:

   *  [I-D.netana-nmop-yang-anydata-validation] addresses that anydata
      modeled nodes can be validated with YANG Library RFC 8525. 6WIND
      VSR and Huawei VRP YANG-Push publisher and open-source
